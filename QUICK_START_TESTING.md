## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Test not found" when creating schedule

**Solution:**
- Verify test ID is correct
- Check test exists in MongoDB
- Test ID should be 24-character hex string

**How to get valid test ID:**
```bash
# MongoDB Shell
use test_series_db
db.tests.findOne()._id
```

### Issue: Student doesn't see scheduled tests

**Solutions:**
1. Verify student has active subscription for that exam type
2. Check subscription expiry date is in future
3. Check scheduled test is active (isActive: true)
4. Verify exam type matches between subscription and schedule

### Issue: Scheduled dates not generated

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure end date is after start date
2. For custom schedule, make sure at least one day is selected
3. Check backend logs for errors

### Issue: Modal doesn't close after submit

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API response is successful
3. Ensure form validation passes
