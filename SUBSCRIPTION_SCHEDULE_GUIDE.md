## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. "Test not found" when scheduling:**
- **Cause:** Invalid test ID
- **Solution:** Get test ID from manage questions or create test first

**2. Students don't see scheduled tests:**
- **Cause:** No active subscription for that exam type
- **Solution:** Grant subscription first, then create schedule

**3. "Subscription not found" error:**
- **Cause:** Trying to edit non-existent subscription
- **Solution:** Grant new subscription instead of editing

**4. Dates not showing correctly:**
- **Cause:** Timezone mismatch
- **Solution:** Backend uses UTC, frontend converts to local time

**5. Schedule created but no dates generated:**
- **Cause:** End date before start date
- **Solution:** Check date inputs, end must be after start

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Send email when subscription granted
   - Remind students of scheduled tests (1 day before)
   - Notify when subscription expiring

2. **Bulk Actions**
   - Import students from CSV
   - Bulk grant subscriptions
   - Export subscription reports

3. **Advanced Scheduling**
   - Time-specific scheduling (9 AM every day)
   - Multi-test series (5 tests in sequence)
   - Prerequisite tests (must complete Test 1 before Test 2)

4. **Analytics**
   - Subscription revenue tracking
   - Test completion rates for scheduled tests
   - Student engagement metrics

5. **Calendar View**
   - Visual calendar for scheduled tests
   - Drag-and-drop rescheduling
