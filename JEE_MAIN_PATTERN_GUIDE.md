## üöÄ How to Use

### For Admins: Creating JEE Main Test

#### Method 1: Via API (Postman/cURL)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/generate-jee-main-test \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "JEE Main Mock Test 2025",
    "examType": "JEE"
  }'
```

#### Method 2: Via Admin Panel (Coming Soon)
We'll add a button in admin dashboard to generate JEE Main tests automatically.

### For Students: Taking JEE Main Test

1. Navigate to the test
2. Read instructions carefully
3. Click "I am ready to begin"
4. Test interface opens with:
   - Physics selected by default
   - Section A displayed first
   - Timer starts counting down
5. Answer questions:
   - **Section A:** Click on options
   - **Section B:** Enter numerical value
6. Use question palette to navigate
7. Mark questions for review if needed
8. Submit when done (or auto-submit at time end)

## üìã Scoring System

### Section A (MCQ):
```
Correct Answer: +4 marks
Incorrect Answer: -1 mark
Unattempted: 0 marks
```

### Section B (Numerical):
```
Correct Answer: +4 marks
Incorrect/Unattempted: 0 marks (NO NEGATIVE MARKING)
```

### Maximum Score Calculation:
```
Per Subject:
- Section A: 20 √ó 4 = 80 marks
- Section B: 5 √ó 4 = 20 marks (only 5 out of 10)
- Total per subject: 100 marks

Total Test: 3 √ó 100 = 300 marks
```

   - Order matters! Choose wisely which 5 to attempt

2. **No negative marking in Section B**
   - Safe to guess if unsure
   - But remember only 5 count

3. **Numerical answers**
   - Must be between 0 and 9999
   - Decimals allowed (e.g., 12.5, 0.333)
   - Answer is considered correct if within range

### General Rules:

1. **You can:**
   - Navigate between subjects anytime
   - Jump to any question directly
   - Mark questions for review
   - Change answers before submitting

2. **You cannot:**
   - Extend the time
   - Go back after submission

## üéì Best Practices for Students

### Time Management:
- **60 minutes per subject** (recommended)
- Allocate time:
  - Section A: 40-45 minutes (2 min/question)
  - Section B: 15-20 minutes (attempt 5)

### Strategy:
1. Start with easiest subject for you
2. Attempt all Section A first (compulsory)
3. Then choose 5 Section B questions you're confident about
4. Use "Mark for Review" for doubtful questions
5. Return to marked questions if time permits
6. **DON'T** attempt > 5 Section B questions accidentally

### Section B Tips:
- Answer ONLY 5 questions you're sure about
- No penalty for wrong answer, but wasted time
- Check decimal places carefully
- Round as per instructions
